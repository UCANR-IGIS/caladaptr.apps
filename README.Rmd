`caladaptr.apps` provides an easy way to run Shiny apps that use the [caladaptr](https://ucanr-igis.github.io/caladaptr/) package. 

# Installation

`caladaptr.apps` is on r-universe and can be installed as follows:

``` r
options(repos = c(ajlyons = 'https://ajlyons.r-universe.dev', CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

```

Alternately you can install it directly from Github:

## Launch the time series app
